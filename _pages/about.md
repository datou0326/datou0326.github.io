I am currently a Master candidate in the School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Techonology, advised by [Prof. Zhijing Yang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38512188800). I also collaborate with [Dr. Yukai Shi](https://ykshi.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.E. degree and advised by [Prof. Jie Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=HPUG2jwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in the School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Techonology. 

Now I am a visiting student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering,¬†[IMAG](https://imag-njust.net/), Nanjing University of Science and Technology, advised by¬†[Prof. Jinshan Pan](https://jspan.github.io/).

Research interest: Image/Video Deblurring, AI for Human Centric (Virtual Try-on, Human Synthesis), Diffusion. 

***Never stop looking for collaboration, kindly contact me via email.***


# üî• News
- *2023.1*: üéâüéâ One paper about ***virtual try-on*** was accpeted by IEEE TMM [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00965.pdf)], and the official code was released in [DOC-VTON](https://github.com/JyChen9811/DOC-VTON). Besides, we provide visualization results of various state-of-the-art methods, and auxiliary data of VITON and VITON-HD.
